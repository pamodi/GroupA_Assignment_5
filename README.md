# Group A - Assignment 5 - User Management API Server

## Overview
This Go-based API server develop a user management application where registration is gated behind an invitation code. Only users with a valid invitation code can register. Each invitation code can only be used once. Implemented an API with Go that exposes endpoints for user registration, login, and inviting new users and used PostgreSQL to store user details and invitation codes.

## Objectives
* Develop an API Server in Go to handle GET and POST requests.
* Integrated Postgres DB.
* Implement secure APIs by using JWT tokens.
* Add background job to resend invitation codes.
* Implement a rate limiter to prevent brute force attacks on the login endpoint.
* Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment.
* Manage the codebase and track changes using GitHub.
* Team Collaboration.
* Merging the code from different team members and resolving the conflicts before pushing to the repository.

## Components in the project
* `main.go`: This is the application's starting point. It includes the main() method, which is where any Go program begins to run and the logic which is used for the API server.
* `go.mod`: Go modules offer a dependency management framework.The project's information, including the versions of its dependencies, is contained in the go.mod file.
* `go.sum`: This file contains the expected cryptographic checksums of the content of specific module versions.
* `README.md`: The file which contains the primary documentation and introduction of the project.

## API Specification

  * Request Header Parameter:
    ```
    {
        "Authorization":"bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3RAZ21ha"
    }
    ```
  * Example request: `http://localhost:8012/register`
  * Example request parameters: 
    ```
    {
    	"email": "test@gmail.com",
    	"password": "123456",
    	"code": "HEDhtMPaFyDtR3oVV7FYeg=="
    }
    ```
  * Example response:
    ```
    {
    	"email": "test@gmail.com",
    	"password": "123456",
    	"code": "HEDhtMPaFyDtR3oVV7FYeg=="
    }
    ```

* Login Request
  * Method: POST
  * Endpoint: `/login`
  * Description: Accepts email and password as request body and returns the success message once the user logged in
  * Request Header Parameter:
    ```
    {
        "Authorization":"bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3RAZ21ha"
    }
    ```
  * Example request: `http://localhost:8012/login`
  * Example request parameters: 
    ```
    {
    	"email": "test@gmail.com",
    	"password": "123456"
    }
    ```

## Steps Used to Create Docker Container with Database
* Replace the database user and password according to the userâ€™s system in main.go and setup_postgres.sh files.
   * setup_postgres.sh
    ```
    POSTGRES_USER=""
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""
    ```
  * main.go
  ```
  const (
  	host     = "localhost"
  	port     = 5432
  	user     = ""
  	password = ""
  	dbname   = "user_management_db"
  )
  ```
* Run the following command to create the container and the postgres database.
  `./setup_postgres.sh `
* Docker container along with the database should be created. Use DBeaver to login to the database by creating the connection using the username and password which was used in the above steps.

## Getting Started 
* Ensure you have Go, Docker, DBeaver and Postman installed on your system.
* Clone the repository from GitHub.
```
git clone https://github.com/pamodi/GroupA_Assignment_5.git
```
* Run the setup postgres file using the below command.
```
./setup_postgres.sh
```
* Run the go project.
```
go run main.go
```

## Special Features

* Integrated PostgreSQL database.
* User passwords are stored in database by encrypting using a hashing algorithm.
* API security has been implemented using the API token generation using JWT tokens.
* A background job will be processing to fetch the unused expired invitation codes and resend a new code to the respective users. The resending to be implemented in future where users will receive an email of the new code with the register instructions.
* A rate limiter function has been implemented to prevent brute force attacks on the login endpoint.
* Basic session management has been implemented to maintain user login state.

## Version History

* Initial Version - V1
